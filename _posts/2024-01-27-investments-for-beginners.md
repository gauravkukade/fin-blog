### 1.  Savings Accounts and Fixed Deposit (FD):

#### a. Savings Accounts

### 4. Bond Funds:

Bond funds invest in a variety of bonds, offering a fixed income stream through periodic interest payments. They are generally considered less risky than individual bonds because the risk is spread across multiple issuers.

Governments are considered as the most secured bonds since there is very low probability that a government will defaults.

### 5. Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs): 

The investors who are interested in real estate sector can invest in REITs. REITs are the companies who own and manage income-generating real estate.

By investing in REITs you do not have to manage physical properties. The investment amount will be less as compared to purchasing real peice of land or property.

### 6. Educational Investments:

Once you started saving more, you can invest this money in above asset classes.
